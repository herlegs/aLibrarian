Introduction
====================

aLibrarian is an app that connects NUS Library, Amazon user comments and Second-hand textbooks resale together.

Firstly, aLibrarian allows NUS students to check library resources, which aim to provide checking, booking and reserving books on mobile devices. Besides, students can view related user comments on the book through integrated Amazon user comments.

Secondly, aLibrarian aims to improve second-hand textbooks exchange. This is because there are some limitations of the current IVLE used books forum: difficult to find desired textbooks because the forum is categorized in faculty, difficult to compare the price of a textbook and lack of pictures of the textbooks to justify the book condition (take photo and upload it to forum is troublesome).
